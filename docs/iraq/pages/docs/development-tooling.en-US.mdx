## Local database 
### Connect DBeaver to the Docker MariaDB container
1. Update the openmrs user to be usable from the host machine
```shell
## Login in the MariaDB container
docker exec -it lime-emr-project-demo-db-1 sh
## Connect to MySQL as root
mysql -u root -p 
## Update the host allowance of the openmrs user 
update mysql.user set host='%' where user='openmrs'
```
2. In MariaDB
  a. Set the server host as "localhost", the port as "3306", the database as "openmrs" and the database authentication username as "openmrs" 
  b. In the driver properties, set the "allowPublicKeyRetrieval" to "true"
3. Test the connection to confirm that it is successful
4. Configure the Proxy SSH/Proxy to do the same on a remote server
